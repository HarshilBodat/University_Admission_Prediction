### University Admission Prediction

Welcome to the University Admission Prediction project! This repository contains code and resources for predicting the likelihood of admission to a university based on various applicant features using data science and machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to help prospective students estimate their chances of admission to different universities.

#### Project Overview

Admission to universities is influenced by various factors such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, academic performance, and more. This project aims to analyze these factors and build predictive models to estimate the probability of admission, assisting students in making informed application decisions.

#### Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Cleans and preprocesses admission data to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
  - Handles missing values and encodes categorical data to make it usable for machine learning models.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizes data to identify patterns and relationships between different features and admission chances.
  - Uses plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to gain insights from the data.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Extracts relevant features and creates new ones to improve the performance of prediction models.
  - Includes transformations and interactions of existing features to capture more complex relationships.

- **Model Training**:
  - Implements and trains various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
  - Uses historical admission data to learn patterns and trends that can be used for prediction.

- **Admission Prediction**:
  - Provides admission probability predictions based on the trained models.
  - Outputs predicted probabilities for given applicant features, helping users estimate their chances of admission.

- **Evaluation and Metrics**:
  - Includes evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to assess model performance.
  - Compares results across different models to select the best-performing one for admission prediction.
